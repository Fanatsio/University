*INTRO


   This is a simplified demonstration of hypertext.  To
   illustrate how hypertext works, click on the following
   embedded "hyperword": EXAMPLE.  Clicking on this or any
   other hyperword retrieves additional information related
   to the selected hyperword.



*EXAMPLE


   The information displayed here is retrieved from an external
   file called INFO.TXT.  Any hypertext file must have a .TXT
   suffix.  The file can be produced by any word processor that
   can save an ASCII file.  Alternatively, the file can be
   created as a .KBS file using VP-Expert's editor and copying
   the saved file to a named .TXT file.  To do this, exit
   VP-Expert, enter DOS, and type at the prompt:

         A>COPY [file].KBS [file].TXT
